## Inspiration
**Mental health awareness** is a conversation that is not talked about as much as it should be. People might not always have someone available to talk to. We wanted to create something the would help address that; a free service that allows strangers to make connections and help each other out.

## What it does
Veost matches two random people up depending on whether they want to vent or roast, and allows them to communicate using their webcam, microphone, and chat box. Those using the Vent option are expected to maintain a safe space and respectful tone, while those using the Roast option are free to say whatever they want.

## Made with
Python, Flask, Jinja, Tokbox, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Challenges faced:
CSS of Tokbox video components for clean UI.

## Plans for future
Chatbox when audio and video unnecessary.
